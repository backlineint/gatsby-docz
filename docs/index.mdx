# Getting Started

## Overview
The overall hollyhunt.com ecosystem is comprised of the following:
- [This shared design system](https://bitbucket.org/hs2studio/holly-hunt-design-system)
- [Drupal website implementation](https://bitbucket.org/hs2studio/holly-hunt-d8)
- [React app implementation](https://bitbucket.org/hs2studio/holly-hunt-portal)

It is recommended that you review the readme at the root of all projects to familiarize with the dependencies and build process for each. This design system will provide all styles shared between the Drupal and React implementations and will be imported into those projects as a devDependency in their respective `package.json`.

This design system will also serve as the overall design system documentation, as such expect it to evolve along with the project.

## Creating pages and using components
Provide information on how to properly link up design system files in order to create a basic "hello world" template. From there, describe the process of incorporating design system's components into the project. Again, this will undoubtedly vary based on the setup and technologies your organization utilizes.

## Code conventions
